# AGENTS.md - Instructions for AI Agents

This file is the single source of truth for all AI agents working in this repository. It provides guidance on architecture, development workflows, coding standards, and available tools. All agents, including Jules, Claude, Gemini, and others, are expected to adhere to these instructions.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Proactive and Autonomous**: Take initiative. If you see code that needs fixing or testing, do it. Don't wait to be asked.
2.  **Follow the Plan**: Adhere to the established development workflow and coding conventions outlined in this document.
3.  **Verify Your Work**: Always run tests after making changes to ensure you haven't introduced any regressions. Use `pre-commit` to check for linting and formatting issues.
4.  **Communicate Clearly**: Provide clear summaries of your work, the tests you ran, and any issues you encountered.

## Agent Roles & Personas

To handle specific tasks effectively, you may adopt one of the following personas.

### Default Persona: Software Engineer

Unless a specific role is required, you are a senior software engineer. Your goal is to understand the user's request, formulate a plan, and execute it efficiently. You are responsible for writing, debugging, and testing code in adherence with all conventions in this document.

### Specialized Persona: QA & Test Engineer

**When to use**: When code changes have been made and you need to ensure quality through automated testing. Use this persona proactively after any code modifications to validate functionality and fix issues.

**Responsibilities**:
1.  **Analyze Change Scope**: Determine which components (agents, libraries) have been modified and identify the correct test suite to run.
2.  **Execute Targeted Testing**:
    - For agent changes: `cd agents/[agent_name] && poetry run pytest`
    - For library changes: `cd libs/[library_name] && poetry run pytest`
    - For broad changes: `poetry run pytest` from the repo root.
    - **Always run pre-commit hooks**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
3.  **Systematically Analyze Failures**: Parse error messages and stack traces to find the root cause. Distinguish between syntax errors, logic errors, and dependency issues.
4.  **Implement Fixes**: Correct code, update dependencies with Poetry, and adjust test configurations as needed.
5.  **Validate and Report**: Re-run tests to confirm fixes and report a clear summary of tests executed, issues found, and fixes applied.

## Architecture Overview

This is a monorepo for a multi-agent home intelligence system built with Google ADK (Agent Development Kit). The system uses a hierarchical agent architecture where specialized agents handle specific tasks.

### Repository Structure
- `agents/` - Individual deployable AI agents, each with their own `pyproject.toml`
- `libs/` - Shared Python libraries used across agents
- Root `pyproject.toml` - Shared development tools (black, flake8, pre-commit)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Monorepo with Poetry**: Uses path dependencies between agents and libraries for local development.
- **Shared Logging**: All components use `common_logging.logging_utils.setup_logging()` for consistent logging.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: A supervisor agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.
- **Agent Instructions**: All agent instructions are defined in code within each agent's `agent.py` file, not in separate instruction files.

## Development Workflow

### **CRITICAL: Branching Strategy**
Before starting any work, you must be on a feature branch.
- **If on `main` branch**: Immediately create a new, descriptively-named feature branch (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`).
- **If on an existing feature branch**: You may continue work on that branch.

### **CRITICAL: Post-Pull Dependency Synchronization**
After pulling from main (e.g., `git pull origin main`), **ALWAYS** run the complete environment synchronization workflow to prevent dependency-related issues.

**Automated Script (Recommended)**:
```bash
# Full synchronization (run this after git pull)
./sync-deps.sh
```
This script handles installation for the root and all sub-component `poetry` environments, and updates `pre-commit` hooks. Use it to ensure your environment is always in sync.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
```bash
# Install all dependencies (from repo root)
./sync-deps.sh

# Run tests across all components
poetry run pytest

# Format code (Handled by pre-commit)
poetry run black .

# Lint code (Handled by pre-commit)
poetry run flake8 .

# Run pre-commit hooks on all files (CRITICAL)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Code Conventions

**CRITICAL**: All code must adhere to these standards to pass CI checks.

### Dependency Management
- ✅ **Use Poetry**: All components use `pyproject.toml` with Poetry.
- ❌ **Never use pip/requirements.txt**.
- ✅ **Use `poetry add`** to add new dependencies.

### Logging Setup
All agents and tools must initialize logging using the shared utility:
```python
from common_logging.logging_utils import setup_logging
setup_logging(service_name="your_agent_name")
```

### Code Style and Linting (Flake8 & Black)
- **Max Line Length**: 88 characters.
- **Remove unused imports**.
- **Never use bare `except:`**; always specify `except Exception:`.
- **Use f-strings only when they have placeholders**.
- Pre-commit hooks are configured to enforce these standards. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before finalizing work.

## Todo Management

**IMPORTANT**: Use GitHub Issues exclusively for todo tracking. Do not use Markdown files or local notes. When asked to record a todo, create a detailed GitHub Issue.
